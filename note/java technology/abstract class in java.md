## thing in abstract class in java 
- abstract class in java you can define method and varible that have other key word then final static public 
- in these abstract class the main ideal is to share your code and help implement method that have a similar property to those in the abstract class without the need to implement all of the method 
## comparison with the interface class 
- the interface class all method and value must be declare final static public 
- all method must be implemented  in the sub-class 
## when to used interface when to used abstract class 
interface : 
- when you want to implement the method without worrying about implementation  detail 
abstract : 
- when you want to code share and have method that are not implemented from the abstract class
